# partypeoplegenerator
The party people generator provides people their party name. 

Developed with Pycharm

The export to html file exists because I thought I could upload the code via html into github, which actually did not work.

You can basically ignore every file besides the codesam1.py because thats where you can find the code that allows people to generate their party people name. The triangle I printed at the beginning is not relevant, I was just practicing. 
The code only works when you use not capitalized letters like for example: sam  and f for female. This is very important or it just wont work.
